# PS-MLAI

Basic framework for complex machine learning/AI projects.

### Why use it?

For those who are beginners or intermediates in data science, you might have experienced starting a complex project and ending up with a tangled .py file full of variables, functions, and objects due to the numerous analyses, treatments, and models required.

To avoid this, this repository aims to create a basic framework for ML/AI projects. With this structure, we achieve better organization, well-defined processes, easy code maintenance, and process monitoring through logs.
